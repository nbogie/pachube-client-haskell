if you post to create a new env with xml, without Content-Length header, you are given a 400: The feed is empty.  This is confusing.  Should be a 411 - length required, if the work cannot be done without length being specified. 

Left "HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request \r\nDate: Thu, 14 Apr 2011 16:39:48 GMT\r\nContent-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8\r\nConnection: close\r\nCache-Control: no-cache\r\nContent-Length: 118\r\nAge: 0\r\n\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?><errors><title>XML Parser Error</title><error>The feed is empty</error></errors>"
